# Current System

* [Rich Dad's Cashflow Quadrant](https://www.richdad.com/cashflow-quadrant):
  * **Employee**: wants security, no risk, lowest paid. Money growth = work more hours, linearly higher salary. Tax: usually the highest.
  * **Self-employed**: some security, less risk, better paid. Money growth = work more hours, linearly higher salary. Tax: as employees or lower.
  * **Business owner**: more risk. Money growth = successful business, linear salary growth to exponential shares growth. Tax: usually lower than employees.
  * **Investor**: little to high risk, best paid. Money growth = exponential. Tax: usually the lowest.
* [Follow The Money Pyramid](http://www.thrivemovement.com/followthemoneypyramid) - an (speculative) attempt to give an overview where the most money is and who rules over how the financial systems work:
  * **Financial Elite** - speculative who, what, why.
  * [**Bank for International Settlements**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_for_International_Settlements) - set reserve requirements, prime counterparty for central banks, little transparency.
  * **International Central Banks** - [**World Bank**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank) and [**International Monetary Fund (IMF)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund)
  * **National Central Banks** - set interest rates, determine the amount of money in circulation, lend to governments at interest.
  * **Banks** - offer loans to corporatoins and people, hold their money, create money through fractional reserve banking.
  * **Corporations** - some are bigger than some countries.
  * **Government** - 
  * **People, Planet, Living Things** - the majority of living beings and the planet.
