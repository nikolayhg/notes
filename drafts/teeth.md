## Vitamins and Minerals

### Vitamin C

Function:
- heals gums/wounds, receding gums, gingival bleeding

Types of Vitamin C:
- Ascorbic acid (ascorbate) C6H8O6 (German: Ascorbinsäure)
- **Sodium ascorbate** (E301, mineral ascorbate), C6H7NaO6 (German: Natriumascorbat)
	- the sodium salt of ascorbic acid
	- 1,000 mg of sodium ascorbate contains 889 mg of ascorbic acid and 111 mg of sodium
	- antioxidant and an acidity regulator.
	- Sodium ascorbate is produced by dissolving ascorbic acid in water and adding an equivalent amount of sodium bicarbonate in water
- **Calcium ascorbate** (E302) CaC12H14O12 (German: Calciumascorbat)
	- approximately 10% calcium by mass
- Potassium ascorbate, E303, C6H7KO6
- Magnesium ascorbate, C12H14MgO12

Dose:
- normal: 2-3g per day
- cure: 2-5g per day, distributed during the day.
- increase bioavailability with: citric or orange essential oil

Foods with Vitamin C:
- Raw Sweet red/green pepper, orange, strawberries, brocolli, potato, cantaloupe, lemon, white grapefruit

### Vitamin D3

Function:
- helps reabsorb Calcium in the gut

Issues:
- Hypercalcemia: too much Vitamin D could lead to Hypercalcemia = highly increased Caclium in the blood which could lead to calcification of the arteries as a cardiovascular disease (CVD)
  - Consideration: how much is too much when most people are Vitamin D deficient?
  - Prevention: Vitamin K2 can transport Calcium from the blood to the places where it is needed.

Types of Vitamin D:
- todo

Dose:
- normal: 10000 IE
- cure: 30000-50000 IE

Main Source of Vitamin D:
- Sunlight

### Vitamin K2

Function:
- transport Calcium from the blood to the places where it is needed.
- can help regenerating bones and tooth substance.

Types of Vitamin K2:
- todo

Dose:
- normal: 10000 IE
- cure: 5-10 mg, distributed during the day, 33% at 3x during the day. 4 weeks

Sources of Vitamin K2:
- todo

### Calcium

Function:
- for bones

Types of Calcium:
- todo

Dose:
- normal: 
- cure: 1 tbsp dolomite rock

Sources of Caclium:
- dolomite rock, finely ground
- sango corals, finely ground

Foods with Calcium:
- todo

### Magnesium

Function:
- helps regenerate enamel
- helps Calcium go into the bone susbtance
- helps alkalize some body parts, including the saliva, and thus helps regenerating the enamel

Types of Magnesium:
- Magnesium citrate
  - magnesium bound with citric acid
  - the most bioavailable forms of magnesium
  - natural laxative effect, it’s also sometimes used at higher doses to treat constipation.

- Magnesium lactate
  - magnesium binds with lactic acid
  - is easily absorbed and may be a little gentler on your digestive system than other types.
  - It may be more suitable for those who don’t tolerate other forms or need to take especially large doses.

- Magnesium L-threonate
  - magnesium and threonic acid, a water-soluble substance derived from the metabolic breakdown of vitamin C 
  - may support brain health, potentially aiding the treatment of disorders like depression and memory loss. All the same, further studies are necessary.

- Magnesium sulfate / Epsom salt
  - magnesium, sulfur, and oxygen
  - frequently dissolved in water to treat stress and sore muscles. However, very little evidence supports these uses.

- Magnesium glycinate
  - magnesium and the amino acid glycine
  - often used as a standalone dietary supplement to improve sleep and treat a variety of inflammatory conditions, including heart disease and diabetes
  - However, research supporting its efficacy for such conditions is limited.

- Magnesium orotate
  - includes orotic acid, a natural substance involved in your body’s construction of genetic material, including DNA
  - it may promote heart health due to orotic acid’s unique role in the energy production pathways in your heart and blood vessel tissue

Dose:
- normal: 
- cure: 1g elemental Magnesium = 5g Magnesium citrate
- use different types of Magnesium
- increase bioavailability: 

Sources of Caclium:
- Japaneese Nigari (Magnesium chloride), bitter

Foods with Magnesium:
- todo

Others:
- Magnesium oil


### Strontium

Function:
- helps storing Calcium in the bones
- increases bones structure stability

Types of Strontium:
- Strontium citrate

Dose:
- normal: 
- cure:

Sources of Strontium:
- todo

Foods with Strontium:
- todo

### Boron

Function:
- remove excess fluorid from the teeth

Types of Boron:
- todo

Dose:
- normal: 
- cure: 9-30 mg

Sources of Boron:
- todo

Foods with Boron:
- todo

### Silicon

Function:
- increases the growth rate of hair and nails
- incraeses the healing rate of skin and bones

Types of Silicon:
- todo

Dose:
- normal: 1g
- cure: 2g
- duration: months

Sources of Silicon:
- nettle
- red millet, fermented red millet sprouts as powder
- field horsetail as powder (German: Ackerschachtelhalm / Zinnkraut)
- bamboo powder

Foods with Silicon:
- todo

### Molybdenum

Function:
- increases the detoxification capacity, possible to take more detox nutrients
- could help healing Candidiasis
- may reduce caries
- todo: check if those functions are correct.

Types of Molybdenum:
- todo

Dose:
- normal: 
- cure: 
- warning: too much might be an issue

Sources of Molybdenum:
- todo

Foods with Molybdenum:
- green leafy vegetables, beans, lentils, grains, organ meats





## Nutrition

### Protein

Sources of Protein:
- Chlorella (60%), Quinoa, Nuts (Almonds, Walnuts, etc. Peanuts are not nuts!), Seeds (pumpkin, hemp, sesame), fermented soya as miso/natto/tempeh, legumes (beans, lentils, peas)
- Animal protein: beef, eggs, fish (wild salmon, codfish, gilthead, seabass, trout, sardines, mackerel), lamb, poultry, seafood, calf, cow's milk products


## External Dental Care

### Oil Pulling

Function:
- contain lipids that supports the dental pellicle, which protects the tooth from acids.

### Chewing

Function:
- the more we chew the more TH17 cells are formed which are part of the immune system.

### Saliva

Function:
- prevents dental plaque, caries and other dental diseases
- deposits minerals in the tooths
- contains peptid histatin which kills pathogenic germs
- contains immunoglobulin, part of the immune system
- the more saliva, the better pH values

Definition:
- salivary flow rate: the average rate at which saliva is produced in the mouth
  - the more saliva, the more it does its functions

Increase the salivary flow rate:
- drink more water
- chew sugar free gums
