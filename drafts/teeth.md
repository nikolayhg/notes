## Nutrition

### Nutrition Overview

- [Ernährungsdesign nach Dr. Dominik Nischwitz](https://www.dnaesthetics.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Dna_Heft-FoodDesign_DE_A4_NO%C2%AE_170224.pdf) - protein, carbs (no gluten), fats, fruits, vegetables.
  - [Superfoods by Dr. Dominik Nischwitz](https://i.imgur.com/djsFjT1.png)
- [What to eat in case of Periodontitis (German article by DZW Die Zahnarzt Woche)](https://www.dzw.de/was-essen-bei-parodontitis)
  - reduction of simple carbs: sugar (glucose and isolated fructose), white flour, juices, sweet pastries. Reason: simple carbs promote gingival and periodontal inflammation, tooth decay and obesity. Research: [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26773022/)
  - Reduction of saturated fatty acids, trans fatty acids, omega-6 fatty acids. Reason: Saturated and trans fats are associated with higher incidence of periodontal disease. Research: [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21505204/)
  - Focused intake of omega-3 fatty acids. Reason: can reduce gingival and periodontal inflammation. Research: [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4962497/), [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26885664/)
  - Focused intake of micronutrients. Reason: basis for a healthy function of the metabolism and immune system. The increased intake of micronutrients is associated with a lower incidence of periodontal disease. Research: [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21323711/)
    - Vitamin C: grapefruits, oranges, strawberries, kiwis
    - Vitamin D, B12.
    - Nuts, seeds, magnesium, blueberries, turmeric
  - Focused intake of fiber. Reason: anti-inflammatory, prebiotic and ensure a constant blood sugar level, associated with a lower incidence of periodontal disease. Research: [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16762952/)
  - Focused intake of plants containing nitrates. Reason: anti-inflammatory, can reduce gingivitis. Research: [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26969836/)

### Protein

Sources of protein:
- Chlorella (60%), Quinoa, Nuts (Almonds, Walnuts, etc. Peanuts are not nuts!), Seeds (pumpkin, hemp, sesame), fermented soya as miso/natto/tempeh, legumes (beans, lentils, peas)
- Animal protein: beef, eggs, fish (wild salmon, codfish, gilthead, seabass, trout, sardines, mackerel), lamb, poultry, seafood, calf, cow's milk products

Avoid:
- gluten: cereal grains


### Carbohydrates

Goal:
- eat carbs with low Glycemic Load (GL). Avoid high GL carbs. [Learn about Glycemic Index & Glycemic Load](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LylsVQ8HFIw)
- eat more complex carbs, with fiber and starch: whole grains, beans, etc

Avoid:
- simple carbs: sugars, syrops, etc
  - causes the bacteria to produce enamel-eating acid
  - prevents absorption of remineralizing nutrients
- whole grains
  - high in phytic acid, inhibits the absorption of essential vitamins and minerals including vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus.

Sources of carbohydrates (low GL):
- todo


### Fats

Source of good fats:
- saturated fats: coconut oil, egg yolk, butter
- monounsaturated fatty acids (MFA): olive oil, nuts
- Omega 3:
  - ALA: linseeds
  - EPA and DHA: fish (wild salmon). Best ratio = 2:1

Bad fats (Omega 6):
- vegetable oils


## Vitamins and Minerals

### Vitamin C

Function:
- heals gums/wounds, receding gums, gingival bleeding

- **Sodium ascorbate** (E301, mineral ascorbate), C6H7NaO6 (German: Natriumascorbat)
	- the sodium salt of ascorbic acid
	- 1,000 mg of sodium ascorbate contains 889 mg of ascorbic acid and 111 mg of sodium
	- antioxidant and an acidity regulator.
	- Sodium ascorbate is produced by dissolving ascorbic acid in water and adding an equivalent amount of sodium bicarbonate in water
- **Calcium ascorbate** (E302) CaC12H14O12 (German: Calciumascorbat)
	- approximately 10% calcium by mass
- Potassium ascorbate, E303, C6H7KO6
- Magnesium ascorbate, C12H14MgO12

Dose:

Foods with Vitamin C:
- Raw Sweet red/green pepper, orange, strawberries, brocolli, potato, cantaloupe, lemon, white grapefruit

### Vitamin D3

Function:
- helps reabsorb Calcium in the gut
- transports Calcium in the bones and teeth, together with the cofactors Magnesium und Vitamin K2

Issues:
- Hypercalcemia: too much Vitamin D could lead to Hypercalcemia = highly increased Caclium in the blood which could lead to calcification of the arteries as a cardiovascular disease (CVD)
  - Consideration: how much is too much when most people are Vitamin D deficient?
  - Prevention: Vitamin K2 can transport Calcium from the blood to the places where it is needed.

Types of Vitamin D:
- todo

Dose:
- normal: 10000 IE
- cure: 30000-50000 IE

Main Source of Vitamin D:
- Sunlight

- [Phosphorous & Magnesium: the Calcium co-workers](https://youtu.be/-BQTOeAdypo?t=25)

### Magnesium

Function:
- helps regenerate enamel
- helps Calcium go into the bone susbtance
- helps alkalize some body parts, including the saliva, and thus helps regenerating the enamel

Types of Magnesium:
- Magnesium citrate
  - magnesium bound with citric acid
  - the most bioavailable forms of magnesium
  - natural laxative effect, it’s also sometimes used at higher doses to treat constipation.

- Magnesium lactate
  - magnesium binds with lactic acid
  - is easily absorbed and may be a little gentler on your digestive system than other types.
  - It may be more suitable for those who don’t tolerate other forms or need to take especially large doses.

- Magnesium L-threonate
  - magnesium and threonic acid, a water-soluble substance derived from the metabolic breakdown of vitamin C 
  - may support brain health, potentially aiding the treatment of disorders like depression and memory loss. All the same, further studies are necessary.

- Magnesium sulfate / Epsom salt
  - magnesium, sulfur, and oxygen
  - frequently dissolved in water to treat stress and sore muscles. However, very little evidence supports these uses.

- Magnesium glycinate
  - magnesium and the amino acid glycine
  - often used as a standalone dietary supplement to improve sleep and treat a variety of inflammatory conditions, including heart disease and diabetes
  - However, research supporting its efficacy for such conditions is limited.

- Magnesium orotate
  - includes orotic acid, a natural substance involved in your body’s construction of genetic material, including DNA
  - it may promote heart health due to orotic acid’s unique role in the energy production pathways in your heart and blood vessel tissue

## External Dental Care

### Oil Pulling

Function:
- contain lipids that supports the dental pellicle, which protects the tooth from acids.

### Chewing

Function:
- the more we chew the more TH17 cells are formed which are part of the immune system.

Sources:
- xylitol gums

### Saliva

Function:
- prevents dental plaque, caries and other dental diseases
- deposits minerals in the tooths
- contains peptid histatin which kills pathogenic germs
- contains immunoglobulin, part of the immune system
- the more saliva, the better pH values

Definition:
- salivary flow rate: the average rate at which saliva is produced in the mouth
  - the more saliva, the more it does its functions

Increase the salivary flow rate:
- drink more water
- chew sugar free gums
  - xylitol recommened
  - avoid: sorbitol, mannitol, maltitol, and erythritol

### Toothbrush
- ultrasonic toothbrush is generally better. But manual is also okay.

### Others

Do:
- go to professional dental cleaning, 2x per year, if possible biological dental care.
- if implants needed, use ceramic, metal free, e.g. zirconium dioxide.
- use calcium bentonite clay
- use homemade tooth soap, book: Good Teeth, Birth to Death Dr. Gerald Judd, PhD
- Brush your teeth effectively
  - soft bristle, at 45 degree, gentle pressure, in small circles (each teeth, 8x times) near the curve of the gums
  - brush your teeth thoroughly and as soon as possible after eating a sugary meal or drink
- Irrigate your teeth and gums thoroughly
  - use oral irrigator

Avoid:
