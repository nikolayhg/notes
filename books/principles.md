# Life Principles

        Embrace reality and deal with it
        By a hyperrealist
            appreciate the beauty of all realities, even harsh ones.
            idealists who are not well grounded in reality create problems, not progress
            it is not a matter of working harder, but working effectively -> increases my capacity by hundreds of times
        Truth (accurate understanding of reality) is the essential foundation for any good outcome
        Be radically open-minded and radically transparent for rapid learning and effective change.
            Don't let fears of others stand in your way
            18 months to change a habits
        Look to nature to learn how reality works
            Nature optimizes for the whole, not for the individual
            People judge good or bad based only on how it affects them
            To be good something must operate consistently with the laws of reality and contribute to the evolution of the whole
            Evolution is the single greatest force in the universe, it is the only thing that is permanent and it drives everything
            Evolution consist of adaptations/inventions that provide benefits that decline in value. That painful decline leads either to new adaptations and new inventions or decline and death
        Evolving is life's greatest accomplishment and reward
            Individual incentives must be aligned with the group's goals
            Reality is optimizing for the whole, not for you
            Adaptation through rapid trial and error is invaluable
            You are simultaneously everything and nothing - and decide what you want to be
        Understand nature's practical lessons.
            Maximize your evolution
            No pain, no gain
            in order to gain strength on e has to push one's limits, which is painful
        Pain + Reflection = Progress
            Reflect while you are in pain or after it passes.
            If not, you miss the progress, you chose comfortable delusion
            The pain is the signal
            Go to the pain rather than avoid it
            Embrace tough love, deny them what they want, so that they can struggle and develop strength
        Weigh second- and third-order consequences
            People who overweight the first-order consequences and ignore the effects of second- and subsequent-order consequences rarely reach their goals
            Often first-order consequences are temptations/barriers that cost us what we really want
        Own your outcomes. Take responsibility. Hold yourself and others accountable
        Look at the machine from a higher level.
