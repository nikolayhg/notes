# Atomic Habits - James Clear

Habits: small and easy action. Compound over the years.

From desire for change/what you want to achieve to:
- who you wish to become.
- System for change.

The Four Laws of Behavior Change: obvious, attractive, easy, satisfying.
Your outcomes/results are a lagging measure of your habits.
3 Layers: identity (belief) -> process (habit) -> results

True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement.

The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.

You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

Ask yourself, “Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?” (Identigy/Beliefs)

Every action is a vote for the type of person you are becoming.

The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible

## Obvious / Clarity (Do):
Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of *awareness* from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your actions.

habit stacking: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].
implementation intention: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].

Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue

It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues

It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it.

Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.

## Attractive / Irresistible (Do)

It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.

One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is to join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the group.

The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual.

## Easy (Do)

The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.

Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors.
Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.

2 Minute Rule: When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.

The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things.

Standardize before you optimize. You can’t improve a habit that doesn’t exist.

The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to automate your habits.
Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior

## Satisfying (Repeat)

The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.

The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.

How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day:
- One of the most satisfying feelings is the feeling of making progress.
- Don’t break the chain. Try to keep your habit streak alive.
- Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible.

Accountability Partner: Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator. Nikolay: make the UNIVERSE/EVERYTHING your observer.

As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored. Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference.

Reflection and review is a process that allows you to remain conscious of your performance over time.
