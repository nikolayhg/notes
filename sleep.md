# Other notes

Sleep Hygiene from hackernoon:

* Block blue light 3–4 hours before sleep. Here is an example of glasses that do that. https://gunnar.com/ (you want the orange-tinted versions)
* Have your bedroom dark (as dark as possible, maybe use an eye mask), cold (18–19 celsius) and humid. Consider https://www.chilitechnology.com/
* Wake at exactly the same time each morning. This is hard, but easier than going to sleep at the same time (which is just impossible).
* Evaluate things that seem to help or disrupt sleep.

Power Sleep for Peak Performance by James B. Maas:
* even minimal sleep loss can have profound detrimental effects on mood, cognition, performance, productivity, communication skills, accident rates, and general health, including gastrointestinal system, cardiovascular functioning, and our immune systems.
* If you’re getting less than eight hours of sleep each night, including weekends, or if you fall asleep instantly, or need an alarm clock to wake up, consider yourself one of the millions of chronically sleep-deprived people
* We must learn to value sleep as much as we value the importance of proper nutrition and exercise. To become peak performers we must change our habits
* Shutting off digital stimulation an hour or two before sleeping; and quiet activities such as taking a bath, listening to soothing music
* Feeling GREAT when I wake up + throughout the day feels *way* better than any late night soul-numbing activities ever could!


Eat, Move, Sleep:
* On average, the best performers slept 8 hours and 36 minutes. The average American, for comparison, gets just 6 hours and 51 minutes on weeknights
