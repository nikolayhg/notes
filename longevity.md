# Aging explained

[Aubrey De Grey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aubrey_de_Grey): Aging as accumulation of damage. [Watch a talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsA__sV0bR4).

| Damage type   | Maintenance approach  |
|----------|:-------------:|
| Cell loss, cell atrophy | Replace, using stem cells |
| Division-obsessed cells | Reinforce, using telomere control |
| Death-resistant cells | Remove, using suicide genes etc |
| Mitochondrial mutations | Reinforce, using backup copies |
| Intracellular waste products | Remove, using foreign enzymes |
| Extracellular waste products | Remove, using immune system |
| Extracellular matrix stiffening | Repair, using crosslink-breakers |

## Exercise

### Exercise Advice by Forever Healthy

Source: [Physical Activity](https://brain.forever-healthy.org/display/EN/Physical+Activity)
* We need to build muscle to reach peak health
  * Advantages: most efficient way to lose weight, better cardio, strengthens the cardio-vascular system, 
* The most effective training is the one that depletes all types of muscle fibers in the shortest amount of time.
* Gym Training:

### Exercise Advice by Peter Attia

Do a lot of consistent preparatory work in the decades prior your 70s.

Train for:
* **Stability**
  * \>10mins/day, >1h/week
  * How?
    * Dynamic neuromuscular stabilization (DNS)
    * [Postural Restoration Institute (PRI)](https://www.posturalrestoration.com/)
    * Pilates
    * The teacher matter a lot!
    * Static stability and dynamic stability
* **Strength**
  * 3x 1h sessions/week
  * with weights or body weight
* **Aerobic efficiency (Zone 2)**
  * min 2h-3h/week
  * Zone 2
    * still able to hold a conversation while training
    * stimulates stimulate Type 1 muscle fibers -> mitochondrial growth and function -> ability to utilize fat and preserve glycogen AND increase lactate clearance capacity
* **Anaerobic work (Zone 5)**
  * high intensity, HIIT
  * not much of it, incorporate into regular activity

More:
* exercise every single day

### Other Exercise Notes
Healthy at 100, John Robbins:
>    “What if there was a pill that would keep you fit and lean as you aged, while protecting your heart and bones? What if it was as good for your brain as for your body, if it made you stronger, more confident, less susceptible to depression? What if it improved your sleep, mood, and memory and reduced your risk of cancer, all while adding life to your years and years to your life? A great number of studies have found that **exercise** can provide all these benefits and more, even for people who begin late in life. We are learning that much of the physical decline that older people suffer stems not from age but from simple disuse.”

* "The researchers found that the frequency of colds among people who exercised five or more days a week was up to 46 percent less than that of people who were largely sedentary—that is, who exercised only one day or less per week." Super Immunity by JOEL FUHRMAN
* aerobics not only releases the endorphins that can combat a down mood but also promotes the growth of the brain (Dan Siegel’s Mindsight)

Michael Lustgarten, PhD, [Interview](https://www.bisu.bio/biohacking-to-100-longevity-lessons-from-15-years-of-self-tracking-ft-michael-lustgarten-phd/)
>    Eight years of an increased average life expectancy came from people who exercise for 30 minutes a day. And this isn’t, strenuous weightlifting. This was as limited as just walking for 30 minutes a day.
