## Exercise

### Exercise Advice by Forever Healthy

Source: [Physical Activity](https://brain.forever-healthy.org/display/EN/Physical+Activity)
* We need to build muscle to reach peak health
  * Advantages: most efficient way to lose weight, better cardio, strengthens the cardio-vascular system, 
* The most effective training is the one that depletes all types of muscle fibers in the shortest amount of time.
* Gym Training:

### Exercise Advice by Peter Attia

Do a lot of consistent preparatory work in the decades prior your 70s.

Train for:
* Stability
  * \>10mins/day, >1h/week
* Strength
  * 3x 1h sessions/week
* Aerobic efficiency (Zone 2)
  * min 2h-3h/week
  * Zone 2
    * still able to hold a conversation while training
    * stimulates stimulate Type 1 muscle fibers -> mitochondrial growth and function -> ability to utilize fat and preserve glycogen AND increase lactate clearance capacity
* Anaerobic work (Zone 5)
  * not much of it, incorporate into regular activity

More:
* exercise every single day

### Other Exercise Notes
Healthy at 100, John Robbins:
>    “What if there was a pill that would keep you fit and lean as you aged, while protecting your heart and bones? What if it was as good for your brain as for your body, if it made you stronger, more confident, less susceptible to depression? What if it improved your sleep, mood, and memory and reduced your risk of cancer, all while adding life to your years and years to your life? A great number of studies have found that **exercise** can provide all these benefits and more, even for people who begin late in life. We are learning that much of the physical decline that older people suffer stems not from age but from simple disuse.”

* "The researchers found that the frequency of colds among people who exercised five or more days a week was up to 46 percent less than that of people who were largely sedentary—that is, who exercised only one day or less per week." Super Immunity by JOEL FUHRMAN
* aerobics not only releases the endorphins that can combat a down mood but also promotes the growth of the brain (Dan Siegel’s Mindsight)

Michael Lustgarten, PhD, [Interview](https://www.bisu.bio/biohacking-to-100-longevity-lessons-from-15-years-of-self-tracking-ft-michael-lustgarten-phd/)
>    Eight years of an increased average life expectancy came from people who exercise for 30 minutes a day. And this isn’t, strenuous weightlifting. This was as limited as just walking for 30 minutes a day.

* Should [train for](https://invidio.us/watch?v=YY-_ux4ZXp4&start=7m46s):
  - Maintaince of muscle mass
  - Joint integrity
  - Flexibility
  - Functional Movement
  - Balance


## Sleep

Factors:

* Get an adequate amount of sleep every night.
  * How do you feel after 9 hours, 7 hours, 5, hours of sleep?
* Stick to a regular sleep schedule
* Develop a relaxing bedtime routine
* Shut off digital stimulation 1-2 hours before
* Take a warm bath
* deep breathing
* progressive muscle relaxation
* enough sunlight during the day
* fresh air
* no late exercise
* magnesium
* Target +1 hour
* Light Bulps without blue light
* Flux


Sleep Hygiene from hackernoon:

* Block blue light 3–4 hours before sleep. Here is an example of glasses that do that. https://gunnar.com/ (you want the orange-tinted versions)
* Have your bedroom dark (as dark as possible, maybe use an eye mask), cold (18–19 celsius) and humid. Consider https://www.chilitechnology.com/
* Wake at exactly the same time each morning. This is hard, but easier than going to sleep at the same time (which is just impossible).
* Evaluate things that seem to help or disrupt sleep.

Power Sleep for Peak Performance by James B. Maas:
* even minimal sleep loss can have profound detrimental effects on mood, cognition, performance, productivity, communication skills, accident rates, and general health, including gastrointestinal system, cardiovascular functioning, and our immune systems.
* If you’re getting less than eight hours of sleep each night, including weekends, or if you fall asleep instantly, or need an alarm clock to wake up, consider yourself one of the millions of chronically sleep-deprived people
* We must learn to value sleep as much as we value the importance of proper nutrition and exercise. To become peak performers we must change our habits
* Shutting off digital stimulation an hour or two before sleeping; and quiet activities such as taking a bath, listening to soothing music
* Feeling GREAT when I wake up + throughout the day feels *way* better than any late night soul-numbing activities ever could!


Eat, Move, Sleep:
* On average, the best performers slept 8 hours and 36 minutes. The average American, for comparison, gets just 6 hours and 51 minutes on weeknights
