# Actions


We can lengthen and strengthen our **telomeres**:
* **Breathing deeply** is actually one of the quickest ways to drop out of super-busy fight-or-flight mode and give your telomeres some rest and lengthening-love
* **Reduce / eliminate the highly processed, sugary foods and sweetened drinks.** (Weâ€™re looking at you, packaged cakes, candies, cookies, and sodas.).
