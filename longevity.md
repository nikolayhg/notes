# Actions


We can lengthen and strengthen our **telomeres**:
* **Breathing deeply** is actually one of the quickest ways to drop out of super-busy fight-or-flight mode and give your telomeres some rest and lengthening-love
* **Reduce / eliminate the highly processed, sugary foods and sweetened drinks.** (We’re looking at you, packaged cakes, candies, cookies, and sodas.).

# Exercise

Healthy at 100, John Robbins:
>    “What if there was a pill that would keep you fit and lean as you aged, while protecting your heart and bones? What if it was as good for your brain as for your body, if it made you stronger, more confident, less susceptible to depression? What if it improved your sleep, mood, and memory and reduced your risk of cancer, all while adding life to your years and years to your life? A great number of studies have found that **exercise** can provide all these benefits and more, even for people who begin late in life. We are learning that much of the physical decline that older people suffer stems not from age but from simple disuse.”

* "The researchers found that the frequency of colds among people who exercised five or more days a week was up to 46 percent less than that of people who were largely sedentary—that is, who exercised only one day or less per week." Super Immunity by JOEL FUHRMAN
* aerobics not only releases the endorphins that can combat a down mood but also promotes the growth of the brain (Dan Siegel’s Mindsight)
