# Books

## [The Good Gut](https://www.redpenreviews.org/reviews/the-good-gut-taking-control-of-your-weight-your-mood-and-your-long-term-health/)
* Increasing fiber intake
* diversifying fiber intake
* eating less meat
* limiting saturated fat intake
* increasing intake of bacteria-rich fermented foods like yogurt and sauerkraut
* Feeding babies breast milk if possible
* exposing oneself to dirt and/or pets
* avoiding unnecessary antibiotics, and taking probiotic supplements at particularly sensitive times (such as after a course of antibiotics).


## Healthy at 100
* Cutting back on calories while maximizing dietary nutrients (Healthy at 100)
  * In these longest-lived cultures (Hunzan, Vilcabambans and Abkhasians):
    * over 90% of the diet comes from plant foods (99% for both Vilcabamba and Hunzan)
    * while NONE of them have any sugar or processed food consumption.
  * Most people would be much better off consuming less meat, milk, sugar, chemicalized, artificial junk food, alcohol, caffeine and tobacco and increasing their consumption of water, whole grains and vegetables, especially dark leafy greens.” in the book Integrative Nutrition by Joshua Rosenthal.



## [Eat, Move, Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17465697-eat-move-sleep):
* We are addicted to refined carbohydrates. You get enough carbohydrates from fruits, vegetables, and protein. Try to reduce your consumption of pasta, bread, rice, and chips in particular. 
    Another study suggests that eating fewer carbs even curbs cancer growth by as much as 50 percent.


## [Super Immunity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11964874-super-immunity):
* Cruciferous veggies.
  * Arugula. Bok choy. Broccoli. Brussels sprouts. Cabbage. Cauliflower. Collards. Horseradish. Kale. Kohlrabi. Mustard Greens. Radishes. Red Cabbage. Turnip greens. Watercress.
    * Green vegetables such as kale, cabbage, collards, and broccoli, plus some nongreen vegetables such as cauliflower and turnips, are called “cruciferous vegetables.” They are named for their flowers, which have four equally spaced petals in the shape of a cross—hence the Latin word crucifer, meaning “cross-bearer.” All vegetables contain protective micronutrients and phytochemicals, but cruciferous vegetables have a unique chemical composition: they have sulfur-containing compounds that are responsible for their pungent bitter flavors. When their cell walls are broken by blending or chopping, a chemical reaction occurs that converts their sulfur-containing compounds into isothiocyanates (ITCs)—an array of compounds with proven and powerful immune-boosting effects and anticancer activity.”
    * 20 percent increase in plant food intake generally corresponds to a 20 percent decrease in cancer rates, but a 20 percent increase in cruciferous vegetable intake corresponds to a 40 percent decrease in cancer rates.
    * Cruciferous vegetables are not only the most powerful anticancer foods in existence; they are also the most micronutrient-dense of all vegetables. Although the National Cancer Institute recommends five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables per day for cancer prevention, they have not yet established specific recommendations for cruciferous vegetables. I recommend six fresh fruits and eight total servings of vegetables per day, including two servings of cruciferous vegetables (at least one raw).
  * GOMBBS
    * Greens, onions, mushrooms, berries, beans, seeds
  * “The most consistent and proven concept in the history of nutritional science is that the combination of high-nutrient intake and low-caloric intake promotes disease resistance and longevity. It is the basis for my health equation
  * White flour, other refined grains (such as those found in sweetened breakfast cereals), soft drinks, sweets, and even fruit juices are weight-promoting, lead to diabetes, and raise triglyceride and cholesterol levels, increasing heart attack risk,  suppress immune function, increasing one’s risk of infection and cancer.
  * how much processed food, french fries, pizza, burgers, and fried rice you can eat and still be protected? My review of the world’s scientific literature over the last twenty years suggests that the combination of processed foods and animal products should comprise less than 10 percent of your total caloric intake.


## [Grain Brain](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17333302-grain-brain):
* One of the largest and most wide-reaching events in the ultimate decline of brain health in modern society has been the introduction of wheat grain into the human diet
* The cornerstone of all degenerative conditions, including brain disorders, is inflammation.
  * gluten, and a high carbohydrate diet for that matter, are among the most prominent stimulators of inflammatory pathways that reach the brain.
* four common foods: (1) a slice of whole-wheat bread, (2) a Snickers bar, (3) a tablespoon of pure white sugar, and (4) a banana. Which one produces the greatest surge in blood sugar—or which has the highest glycemic index (GI), a numerical rating that reflects a measure of how quickly blood sugar levels rise after eating a particular type of food.
   * sugar (GI = 68)
   * candy bar (GI = 55)
   * banana (GI = 54)
  * whole-wheat bread (GI = 71)
* Fat—not carbohydrate—is the preferred fuel for human metabolism and has been for all of human evolution.
  * coconut oil (super brain food!), avocados, olives



## Optimal Nutrition from hackernoon:
* Objective: Eat good stuff. Don’t eat bad stuff. Habituate.
* Objective (sciencey version): minimize insulin levels, maximize glucose disposal, optimize various growth factors (IGF-1, mTOR etc.) towards things we want (e.g. muscle) and away from what we don’t want (e.g. cancer).
* Key tactics:
  * Do not eat sugar in any form.
  * Do not eat processed foods.
  * Do not eat cheap industrially-farmed animal products.
  * Eat mostly plants
  * Eat organic when possible
  * One shouldn’t drink any alcohol
  * One shouldn’t add any salt (increases blood pressure) to food.
  * I do intermittent fasting where for 3 days a week I eat only once a day.

# Fasting

1-3 days fast

# Time-restricted eating

Eating only from 12:00 to 20:00
