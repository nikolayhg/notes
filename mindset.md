# Guidelines

* Raise your standards!
* Once you make a 10x commitment, your brain becomes like a 10x filter:
  * this belongs to 10x, so you keep it.
  * this does NOT belong to 10x, so you stop or delegate it.
* The greater the challenge the more rigorous our routines need to be.
* Install a whole new series of mindsets and rituals that very few people are doing!
* Behave like most people don't behave!
* Spend time with the people that are already that.
* We become the combined average of the 5 people we hang around the most.
* Grow your Leverage = Impact produced / Time invested:
  * Money / Time
  * Energy / Time
  * Decision Making / Time
  * Action / Time
  * The Keys to consistently leverage: A) Know your goals B) Act and Review your time and energy allocation towards those goals

* [Astro Teller â€“ How to Think 10x Bigger](https://tim.blog/2018/04/18/how-to-think-10x-bigger/) - 10x needs suitable environment so that perspective shifts are possible and thriving. In every high and low level (subproblem) you can go 10x. Perspective shifts will unlock more than smartness will.

* A 30min wasteful activity per day, wastes you a single waking day per month. [See the calculation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EwTd1w_q4XBIrbEh5T6a6PQsySEQHaZy2M_glMmAXVQ/edit#gid=1392074595)
* A 30min wasteful activity per day for 30 people, wastes the whole month of one person.
* Steals life time.
* Hinders creativity and development.
* Habituates waste creation and repetition.
