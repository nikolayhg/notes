# Clarity

- Assume 100% responsibility for your own level of clarity.
- Stop creating the opposite of clarity.

## Clarity-reducing patterns:

* Hanging out with fuzzy, unfocused people who are drifting aimlessly with no direction
* Living with people whose goals and values are in conflict with yours
* Distracting yourself with excessive TV, web surfing, video games, or other time-wasting habits
* Numbing your mind and emotions with junk food, alcohol, or other addictions
* Overstimulating yourself with caffeine (which for many people leads to racing thoughts)
* Whining about your lack of certainty or complaining that you donâ€™t know what to do
* Clarity-boosting patterns include doing the opposite of the above:

## Clarity-enhancing patterns include:

* Hanging out with clear, focused people who can tell you their purpose and direction
* Living with people whose goals and values align well with yours
* Feeding your mind with inspirational and motivational material like quality books and audio programs
* Eating healthy, unrefined foods (especially fruits and veggies, fresh juices, and smoothies) that keep your mind sharp and alert
* Avoiding stimulants that cause swings in your thoughts and emotions
* Thinking about your goals and the next actions you can take today
* If you find yourself surrounded by people and circumstances that leave you feeling dizzy and confused, drop those elements from your life, and give yourself the space to create and enjoy the clarity you seek. Spinning in circles is unproductive.

* Use visualization to create the vibe of clarity
