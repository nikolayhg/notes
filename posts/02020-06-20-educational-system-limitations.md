# Limitations of the current educational system

It limits you:
1) **WHAT** you learn - only certain categories of knowledge and skills are taught, and they are all set in stone, you are not allowed to learn other categories or other topics within a category. Everyone learns the same subjects, no matter their own desires. Ultimately we should learn the things that we want and need with high probability in life, not that we don't want or might need with very low probability.
2) **HOW** you learn - usually it is a mix of listening to a person and watching drawings on a whiteboard. This is what teachers are being taught and tested to do. The studends consume the information in only one way. They cannot or are not allowed to consume it in other ways possible: listening, reading, watching, change the speed of listening/reading/watching, rewind, sitting, standing, walking, practical, skip the things you know and go the ones you don't know, etc.
3) **from WHOM** you learn - one local teacher for each subject. You can't have more local teachers per subject, or remote teachers, or instead of local teacher, you can't learn from the best educational materials on the planet, etc. The source of knowledge is very important: it can be inspirational, deep, eye opening, mind expanding or it can be mediocre, dry and shallow.
4) **with WHOM** you learn - in school you remain in the same class of people for few to several years, you cannot learn with people outside of your class, or with people of other ages, other cities or countries. Fellow studends can help you learn better and quicker, ideally they will really WANT to learn the subject, but maybe usually <50% of the students in class are genuinely interested in the subject.
5) **WHEN** you learn - only certain months, days and hours are set for learning. In a school usually you learn a subject between 45 mins to max 1.5h per day, only from Monday to Friday, and NOT during the summer break. If you don't want to or can't learn it during the learning hours, you are penalized. If you want to prolong the learning, you can't becase then the next different subject starts.
6) **WHERE** you learn - only in a certain school/university bulding, you can't go to another school/university building, or company building or in nature, or wherever you like or believe would be best for your learning.
7) **WHY** you learn - why you learn WHAT, with WHOM, from WHOM, WHEN and WHERE, is already decided and you don't know the real motivations behind that. If you have a different WHY you learn that would require you to do something different than the educational system, you are on your own.

So our current educational system limits us on WHAT, HOW, from WHOM, with WHOM, WHEN, WHERE and WHY we learn. A limiting learning process will always produce limited knowledge, limited skills, limited opportunities and limited outcomes. For us as students, for us as parents, for us as companies, for us as part of countries and for us as humanity.
