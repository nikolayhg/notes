# Entrepreneurs

# [Elon Musk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk)
Engineer, industrial designer and technology entrepreneur. Founder of PayPal, Tesla, SpaceX, Neuralink, OpenAI.

[10 Rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zX7I_Rw8Q0I):
* Never give up
* Really like what you do
* Don't listen to the little man
* Take a risk
* Do something important
* Focus on signal vs noise
* Look for problem solvers
* Attract great people
* Have a great product
* Work super hard.

# [Sam Altman](http://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful)
American entrepreneur, investor, programmer. Former president of Y Combinator and now the CEO of OpenAI.

* __Compound yourself__ - you should aim for your life to follow an ever-increasing up-and-to-the-right trajectory. Move towards a career that has a compounding effect. Your rate of learning should always be high. It’s useful to focus on adding another zero to whatever you define as your success metric—money, status, impact on the world, or whatever. Long-term thinking with a broad view of how different systems in the world are going to come together.
* __Have almost too much self-belief__ - The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion. Self-belief must be balanced with self-awareness. Truth-seeking is hard and often painful, but it is what separates self-belief from self-delusion.
* __Learn to think independently__ - Thinking from first principles, finding people to exchange them with is a great way to get better at this. The next step is to find easy, fast ways to test these ideas in the real world.
* __Get good at “sales”__ - convince other people of what you believe. My best advice for communicating clearly is to first make sure your thinking is clear and then use plain, concise language. The best way to be good at sales is to genuinely believe in what you’re selling.
* __Make it easy to take risks__
* __Focus__ - is a force multiplier on work. Almost everyone I’ve ever met would be well-served by spending more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Once you have figured out what to do, be unstoppable about getting your small handful of priorities accomplished quickly.
* __Work hard__ - You can get to about the 90th percentile in your field by working either smart or hard, which is still a great accomplishment. But getting to the 99th percentile requires both. Extreme people get extreme results. Working a lot comes with huge life trade-offs, and it’s perfectly rational to decide not to do it. But it has a lot of advantages. As in most cases, momentum compounds, and success begets success. One of the great joys in life is finding your purpose, excelling at it, and discovering that your impact matters to something larger than yourself. Figure out how to work hard without burning out.
* __Be bold__ - it’s easier to do a hard startup than an easy startup. People want to be part of something exciting and feel that their work matters.
* __Be willful__ - you can bend the world to your will a surprising percentage of the time. Most people don’t even try, and just accept that things are the way that they are. I am going to keep going until this works, and no matter what the challenges are I’m going to figure them out. To be willful, you have to be optimistic.
* __Be hard to compete with__ - If what you do can be done by someone else, it eventually will be, and for less money. The best way to become difficult to compete with is to build up leverage. For example, you can do it with personal relationships, by building a strong personal brand, or by getting good at the intersection of multiple different fields.
* __Build a network__ - Great work requires teams. Developing a network of talented people to work with—sometimes closely, sometimes loosely—is an essential part of a great career. The size of the network of really talented people you know often becomes the limiter for what you can accomplish. An effective way to build a network is to help people as much as you can. Develop a reputation for really taking care of the people who work with you. You want to have a reputation for pushing people hard enough that they accomplish more than they thought they could, but not so hard they burn out. Get good at discovering undiscovered talent. Quickly spotting intelligence, drive, and creativity gets much easier with practice.
* __You get rich by owning things__
* __Be internally driven__ - The most successful people I know are primarily internally driven; they do what they do to impress themselves and because they feel compelled to make something happen in the world. This is why the question of a person’s motivation is so important. It’s the first thing I try to understand about someone.
